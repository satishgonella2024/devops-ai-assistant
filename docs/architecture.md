# Project Architecture

## Overview
The DevOps AI Assistant project uses a large language model (LLaMA or similar) to automate and assist with DevOps tasks, such as pipeline generation, troubleshooting, and infrastructure management.

### Components
- **Model**: LLaMA model for natural language understanding and response generation.
- **UI**: A web-based UI (Gradio) for interacting with the model.
- **Docker**: Containers for deployment, allowing easy replication and portability.
- **GPU Acceleration**: Leverage NVIDIA RTX 4080 for AI model inference.
